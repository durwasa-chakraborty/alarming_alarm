# Alarming Alarm!

Alarming Alarm, is an application that does not let you doze off.

The application has been designed very poorly, so any suggestions on how to make applications API friendly, are more than welcome. Please drop me a mail at <mailto: durwasa.chakraborty@gmail.com>.

Run 
* `cd path/to/alarming_alarm`
* `python script.py`
